# Facial Recognition Web Application

Welcome to the **Facial Recognition Web Application**! This project is designed to provide real-time facial recognition capabilities using a **webcam**. It allows administrators to manage authorized users by adding their information and enables searching for users by their faces. The application is built using modern technologies to ensure efficiency and scalability.

## üöÄ Features

1. **User Management**:
   - Add users with name and image details.
   - Search users using facial recognition.
2. **Admin Panel**:
   - Manage authorized users securely.
3. **Real-Time Webcam Integration**:
   - Capture live video streams for recognition.
4. **Responsive UI**:
   - Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and mobile-friendly interface.
5. **Machine Learning Backend**:
   - Trained facial recognition model ensures accuracy and speed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React**: Building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling components for a sleek and responsive design.

### Backend:
- **Machine Learning**: For facial recognition model training and inference.
- **Node.js/Express**: Backend server handling API requests (example stack, update if using something else).
- **Database**: For secure storage of user images and details (e.g., MongoDB).
